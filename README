* Requirements
MySQL 5.1 and higher. If you want to use collation, you'll need that 
collation in mysqld. If you want to use unicode normalization, utf8 charset
must be built in your mysqld.

* SPEC
This plugin implements bi-gram tokenizer. As of MySQL SQL syntax, you can
query in natural langauge mode or in boolean mode.

Natural langage mode of n-gram is very complex to understand. 
Basically, it scores higher for more similar sentences found in the database. 
You can't specify the operators such as + or -, what appears in boolean mode.
You can only pass a sentence and get a result set according to the similarity.

Boolean mode of n-gram is easy to understand. You can specify which sentence
to be present or not. You can't use trunc operator because it was impossible
to use prefix match in the MySQL index when the index is bi-gram.

Both natural language mode and boolean mode use unicode internally, and
collates with unicode collation. The encoding conversion is done automatically.
