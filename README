MySQL 5.1 and higher. ucs2_unicode_ci collation is required to be available.


* INSTALL
If you check out the source from the repository, you need autoconf, automake and libtool 
to build the plugin. Type as following:
$ aclocal
$ libtoolize --automake
$ automake --add-missing
$ touch INSTALL NEWS AUTHORS ChangeLog

* SPEC
This plugin implements bi-gram tokenizer. As of MySQL SQL syntax, you can
query in natural langauge mode or in boolean mode.

Natural langage mode of n-gram is very complex to understand. 
Basically, it scores higher for more similar sentences found in the database. 
You can't specify the operators such as + or -, what appears in boolean mode.
You can only pass a sentence and get a result set according to the similarity.

Boolean mode of n-gram is easy to understand. You can specify which sentence
to be present or not. Current limitation is that you can't use boolean syntax,
such as + or -. All you can do is pass a sentence and get a result set which
a row does have a specified sequence.

Both natural language mode and boolean mode use unicode internally, and
collates with unicode collation. The encoding conversion is done automatically.


* TODO
- support of boolean mode syntax
